+Code the following app
+```
+Number Tapping Sequence where the user taps numbers from 1 to 25 as fast as possible. The app should display a 5×5 grid containing the numbers 1 to 25 in random order. When the user taps the correct number in sequence, starting from 1, the tapped number should be disabled or removed, and the entire grid should automatically reshuffle to increase difficulty. Incorrect taps should be ignored. The timer must start when the user taps number 1 and stop immediately after tapping number 25, showing the live elapsed time throughout the game. When the user finishes, the app should display a completion screen showing the final time along with a button to restart the game. The interface should be clean and minimalist, with large tappable number tiles and a visible timer at the top. The game must include states for not started, running, and finished, and should reset properly whenever the player chooses to play again.
